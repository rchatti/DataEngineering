GroupByKey is:
- a Beam transform for processing collections of key/value pairs. 
- Itâ€™s a parallel reduction operation, analogous to the Shuffle phase of a Map/Shuffle/Reduce-style algorithm. 

The input to GroupByKey is: 
- a collection of key/value pairs that represents a multimap, 
    where the collection contains multiple pairs that have the same key, but different values. 
    
Given such a collection, you use GroupByKey to collect all of the values associated with each unique key.
